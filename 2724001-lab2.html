                <h2> About Me</h2>
                <p> My name is Kaylan Gokal. I am currently a third year computer science student at Wits. I really enjoy dancing and my current outlook on life is making good memories.</p>

                <h3> Latest Project </h3>
                <p> In 2024, Wits hosted a snake game for the second year students which allowed us to code the AI for our own snakes to compete against others. We had to implement stragtegies for our snake to find the shortest path to the apple while also trying to dodge obstacles and zombie snakes. I am proud of this as I came 11th and funny enough I only used a breadth first search with some smart tweaks.</p>
